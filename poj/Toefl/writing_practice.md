### Education - TPO 50 :book:
    Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? All university students should be required to take history courses no matter what their field of study is. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

>Attitude:Neutral
>>Nowadays, with the advent of modernization, more and more employers are seeking for high-end talents and professionals to enhance their companies' overall competitiveness, thus creating a much more throat-cutting job market than before. Under this circumstance, universities are planning to require all the students to take more compulsory basic courses, which could equip them with more knowledge and secure them a promising future career and among all the subjects, history is undoubtedly one of them. Some people assert that it is indeed necessary for all university students to sign up for history courses regardless of their major might be. Nevertheless, from my perspective, not all of them should be required to take the history class and how many students should take history courses depends on their own major.   Firstly, it is unnecessary for IT majors to learn history courses. If we consider/take into account/factor what IT students’ future job might be, it is a lot more likely that most of them would sit in front of their computers or laptops, stare at their screen and program all sorts of useful and time-saving software. Take Bill Gates, the founder of the well-known Microsoft Corporation, for example. Before he turned Microsoft into a successful commercial software company, Bill himself also began his career as an average software engineer. Fortunately, thanks to his marvelous expertise, he then stood out in his career and grabbed the very chance to establish his commercial empire. Although he doesn’t know the slightest piece of history knowledge, he could still succeed in that his success has nothing to do with history but his outstanding specialty, persistent character and destiny’s favor.   Secondly, accounting majors also are those students who don’t need to learn history. During the four-year university period, accounting majors are not only burdened with loads of assignments and presentations but plenty of professional qualifications to acquire, from CPA to ACCA (abbreviations for both Certified Public Accountant and The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants). If these students want to ensure a lucrative career in the future, it is better for them to spend more time preparing for these essential certificates. For instance, my brother, who also majors in accounting always stays up late to cram for his exams, papers and certificates because to him how to find a decent job is the first priority after his graduation.   Of course, some students majoring in English and archeology may need to take history courses, because knowing something in history could deepen their understanding of their major study. For instance, if an English major has an idea of what once happened to Britain in the past hundreds of years and how it has shaped the country’s current culture, he could better understand the evolution of English language as a whole, what their language looked like during Shakespeare’s time and why poet would write some poems with certain contents.   In a nutshell, it is absurd to assert that all university students should be required to take part in history courses but for some majors, such as English and archeology, learning is definitely a plus.

### Work - TPO 42 :computer:
    Workers are more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do during the workday than when they do similar tasks all day long. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

>Attitude:Agree~
>>There are different standpoints regarding the happiness from the work. Some argue that workers would gain more satisfaction from doing different types of tasks while others hold the opposite idea that to do the same task leads them to be happier. In fact, it is hard to judge and up to the context of the work. Obviously, the majority of people are reluctant to repeat their action mechanically, because they cannot endure the tediousness created by the same work. Trying to do different types of tasks is beneficial for them to keep the motivation of job and is easy to satisfy themselves with achieving success in varied domains. Meanwhile, however, other consequences as a result from dissimilar sorts of work are supposed to be taken into account as well. The different types of tasks would make it impossible for workers to be happy sometimes: they coerce these people to face new challenges and it costs more time to acquaint every kind of tasks which even would be changed definitely in the second day. Except few extremely bold people, a huge number of workers will feel quite stressful when something is completely new for them. Further, the same type of task doesn’t mean the context of the job is the same. People are likely to suffer from varied kinds of formidableness in the daily work. An architect should do several different plans for one project. Even though they draw a window for one building’s façade, they have to establish dozens of models of windows to match the whole genre. Besides, if their work does not fulfill their customers’ demands, the architects have no choice but to redraw the façade. This type of work on some stage can also be called working repeatedly, whereas the context is definitely different and filled with challenges. It affords the strong happiness when the clients acclaim the work at last. So, I believe that no one will affirm that being an architect is a boring position even though they only do design every day. Consequently, we have to clarify which reasons lead workers to be happy. How different the type of tasks is unlikely to simply determine how happy workers can be during their workday. If one type of task containing diverse challenges stimulates someone’s motivation, the people would attain likewise pleasure from the work.

### Teenager - TPO 48
    Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Because modern life is very complex, it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize.Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

>Attitude:Agree
>>  Increasingly sophisticated technology, explosive information and intricate international relationships all work together to complicate the modern life, which makes our modern people somewhat overwhelmed. Individuals whoever want to have a better control of one’s life must equip themselves with some essential skills or abilities. Planning and organizing, which embodies the skill of anticipating, influencing, and controlling, in my view, is becoming gradually important in coping with today’s complication especially for the young who are always the most passionate but also with less self-control.    First of all, planning helps keep one on course in achieving goals and crystallize objectives. Young people always possess some grand dreams which may take years to accomplish. Planning ahead, on the one hand, could effectively put one on the right track thus prevent energy from being scattered or wasted. A survey conducted by experts from Oxford University shows that over 90% of elites and enterprisers had precise objects and made plans for decades later at very young age. Like Bill Gates, one of the most prominent persons I have ever seen, discontinued their studies since he was definite aware of what he should do in order to become the leader of IT field. On the other hand, plans, which are organized step by step, could turn the ultimate goals into several achievable ones. With achievable objective achieved one by one, the ultimate goal will finally be attained.    Besides, planning and organizing help to promise one’s best performance in most occasions. Panning means trying to anticipate all the possibilities and arrange things in a scientific order. It clearly tells people what to do currently and what should do the next, which prevents disorder or chaos. Thus, people may feel assured and will be with less stress. For example, a student who sticks to a study plan is less likely to be nervous thus will be more likely to have better performance than those who crams for tests. Today youngsters are exposed with fierce competitions but also abundant opportunities. Good performance is key to hold these opportunities in hand.    It is undeniable that our society changes at such a quick pace that we cannot plan everything in previous. But this by no means implies that the ability is not important. Without a plan, complex things will only get more complicated. Abraham Lincoln reportedly once said, “If I had 60 minutes to cut down a tree, I would spend 40 minutes sharpening the ax and 20 minutes cutting it down.”  Planning is just like “sharpening the ax”, which will no doubt facilitate a task easy done.    All in all, though the ability of planning and organizing may not be omnipotent for people especially the young to cope with new situations in today’s complex society, it does facilitate to fulfill one’s life goals and help to improve one’s performance when opportunities come.
