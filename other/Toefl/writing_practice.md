### Education - TPO 50 :book:

    Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? All university students should be required to take history courses no matter what their field of study is. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

>Attitude:Neutral
>
>>Nowadays, with the advent of modernization, more and more employers are seeking for high-end talents and professionals to enhance their companies' overall competitiveness, thus creating a much more throat-cutting job market than before. Under this circumstance, universities are planning to require all the students to take more compulsory basic courses, which could equip them with more knowledge and secure them a promising future career and among all the subjects, history is undoubtedly one of them. Some people assert that it is indeed necessary for all university students to sign up for history courses regardless of their major might be. Nevertheless, from my perspective, not all of them should be required to take the history class and how many students should take history courses depends on their own major.   Firstly, it is unnecessary for IT majors to learn history courses. If we consider/take into account/factor what IT students’ future job might be, it is a lot more likely that most of them would sit in front of their computers or laptops, stare at their screen and program all sorts of useful and time-saving software. Take Bill Gates, the founder of the well-known Microsoft Corporation, for example. Before he turned Microsoft into a successful commercial software company, Bill himself also began his career as an average software engineer. Fortunately, thanks to his marvelous expertise, he then stood out in his career and grabbed the very chance to establish his commercial empire. Although he doesn’t know the slightest piece of history knowledge, he could still succeed in that his success has nothing to do with history but his outstanding specialty, persistent character and destiny’s favor.   Secondly, accounting majors also are those students who don’t need to learn history. During the four-year university period, accounting majors are not only burdened with loads of assignments and presentations but plenty of professional qualifications to acquire, from CPA to ACCA (abbreviations for both Certified Public Accountant and The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants). If these students want to ensure a lucrative career in the future, it is better for them to spend more time preparing for these essential certificates. For instance, my brother, who also majors in accounting always stays up late to cram for his exams, papers and certificates because to him how to find a decent job is the first priority after his graduation.   Of course, some students majoring in English and archeology may need to take history courses, because knowing something in history could deepen their understanding of their major study. For instance, if an English major has an idea of what once happened to Britain in the past hundreds of years and how it has shaped the country’s current culture, he could better understand the evolution of English language as a whole, what their language looked like during Shakespeare’s time and why poet would write some poems with certain contents.   In a nutshell, it is absurd to assert that all university students should be required to take part in history courses but for some majors, such as English and archeology, learning is definitely a plus.

### Work - TPO 42 :computer:
    Workers are more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do during the workday than when they do similar tasks all day long. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

>Attitude:Agree~
>
>>There are different standpoints regarding the happiness from the work. Some argue that workers would gain more satisfaction from doing different types of tasks while others hold the opposite idea that to do the same task leads them to be happier. In fact, it is hard to judge and up to the context of the work. Obviously, the majority of people are reluctant to repeat their action mechanically, because they cannot endure the tediousness created by the same work. Trying to do different types of tasks is beneficial for them to keep the motivation of job and is easy to satisfy themselves with achieving success in varied domains. Meanwhile, however, other consequences as a result from dissimilar sorts of work are supposed to be taken into account as well. The different types of tasks would make it impossible for workers to be happy sometimes: they coerce these people to face new challenges and it costs more time to acquaint every kind of tasks which even would be changed definitely in the second day. Except few extremely bold people, a huge number of workers will feel quite stressful when something is completely new for them. Further, the same type of task doesn’t mean the context of the job is the same. People are likely to suffer from varied kinds of formidableness in the daily work. An architect should do several different plans for one project. Even though they draw a window for one building’s façade, they have to establish dozens of models of windows to match the whole genre. Besides, if their work does not fulfill their customers’ demands, the architects have no choice but to redraw the façade. This type of work on some stage can also be called working repeatedly, whereas the context is definitely different and filled with challenges. It affords the strong happiness when the clients acclaim the work at last. So, I believe that no one will affirm that being an architect is a boring position even though they only do design every day. Consequently, we have to clarify which reasons lead workers to be happy. How different the type of tasks is unlikely to simply determine how happy workers can be during their workday. If one type of task containing diverse challenges stimulates someone’s motivation, the people would attain likewise pleasure from the work.

### Teenager - TPO 48 :boy:
    Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Because modern life is very complex, it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize.Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

>Attitude:Agree
>
>>  Increasingly sophisticated technology, explosive information and intricate international relationships all work together to complicate the modern life, which makes our modern people somewhat overwhelmed. Individuals whoever want to have a better control of one’s life must equip themselves with some essential skills or abilities. Planning and organizing, which embodies the skill of anticipating, influencing, and controlling, in my view, is becoming gradually important in coping with today’s complication especially for the young who are always the most passionate but also with less self-control.    First of all, planning helps keep one on course in achieving goals and crystallize objectives. Young people always possess some grand dreams which may take years to accomplish. Planning ahead, on the one hand, could effectively put one on the right track thus prevent energy from being scattered or wasted. A survey conducted by experts from Oxford University shows that over 90% of elites and enterprisers had precise objects and made plans for decades later at very young age. Like Bill Gates, one of the most prominent persons I have ever seen, discontinued their studies since he was definite aware of what he should do in order to become the leader of IT field. On the other hand, plans, which are organized step by step, could turn the ultimate goals into several achievable ones. With achievable objective achieved one by one, the ultimate goal will finally be attained.    Besides, planning and organizing help to promise one’s best performance in most occasions. Panning means trying to anticipate all the possibilities and arrange things in a scientific order. It clearly tells people what to do currently and what should do the next, which prevents disorder or chaos. Thus, people may feel assured and will be with less stress. For example, a student who sticks to a study plan is less likely to be nervous thus will be more likely to have better performance than those who crams for tests. Today youngsters are exposed with fierce competitions but also abundant opportunities. Good performance is key to hold these opportunities in hand.    It is undeniable that our society changes at such a quick pace that we cannot plan everything in previous. But this by no means implies that the ability is not important. Without a plan, complex things will only get more complicated. Abraham Lincoln reportedly once said, “If I had 60 minutes to cut down a tree, I would spend 40 minutes sharpening the ax and 20 minutes cutting it down.”  Planning is just like “sharpening the ax”, which will no doubt facilitate a task easy done.    All in all, though the ability of planning and organizing may not be omnipotent for people especially the young to cope with new situations in today’s complex society, it does facilitate to fulfill one’s life goals and help to improve one’s performance when opportunities come.

### Child - TPO 44 :baby:
    Some people believe that when busy parents do not have a lot of time to spend with their children, the best use of that time is to have fun playing games or sports. Others believe that it is best to use that time doing things together that are related to schoolwork. Which of the two approaches do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

>​	In recent years, there has been a trend among busy parents toward utilizing spare time to have fun such as arts and sports, because these entertainment activities do not have a direct relation with children’s schoolwork. It lies in the fact that education is valuable by people only when it improves students’ academic record. Although playing games and sport are not directly related to academic record, these entertainment activities have countless benefits to students’ success in their future careers. The idea that sport is important to children’s development has been widely accepted.
>
>​	 First of all, sport can enhance intelligence. Playing games enables children to know how to coordinate different parts of their bodies. The advantage is that children who can use sport instruments proficiently cab juggle different task in their adulthood. Playing games can foster the culture of cooperation among teenagers as they are required to collaborate with each other in a basketball team or a football team. Playing games is also considered as a healthy way of relieving stress, because it can lighten one’s mood and reduce anxiety. Playing games also has a beneficial effect on children’s physical and mental health. Children who engage in physical activity can constantly maintain a healthy weight and have stamina to handle their schoolwork. This is particularly important, considering that young people are increasingly addicted to the sedentary activity, such as watching TV. Furthermore, children who exercise habitually normally have a positive attitude to life, which enables them to cope with stress easily.  Therefore, we can see how important some non-academic activities can be to students’ future career success. Sports and playing games can develop students’ intellectual skills and social skills, while they are able to improve students’ physical health and self-esteem.

### Society - TPO 52 :classical_building:
    Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The rules that societies today expect young people to follow and obey are too strict. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

>Within recent 30 years, our society has witnessed and experienced radical changes in each and every aspect of our life. Under this circumstance, young people are also faced with a wide range of temptations and impacts brought by various objects, from fancy entertainment gadgets, to online pornography and to subversive conception, which is why there are many rules nowadays for youngsters to follow and obey to insulate them from juvenile delinquency. However, some people may wonder whether some of these rules are too strict and serious and whether they should make a compromise. As far as I’m concerned, some rules may be too much and even may do harm to their natural development. First, some parents may order their children to devote most of their time to study and prevent them from any access to leisure and entertainment. Frequently, parents would have unreasonable expectations of their kids, hoping that they could show an outstanding performance in their school, be admitted into a top-rank university and own a decent career right after graduation. Because of these expectations, they would set a limit on hours on which children could spend watching television and even register for all kinds of extra curriculums to make their children more competent than their peers. But this teaching method will be very detrimental to their beloved sweethearts in that young children’s instinct prefers relaxing and exciting games and entertainment to tiring and killing studies and assignments. In the long run, it is likely to turn a kid into a dumb nerd, who has no idea of how to relax and enjoy each moment of life. What’s the point of forging a child into an outstanding individual while he loses the fun and joy of life forever and ever? Second, some parents are likely to forbid their children from puppy love or any form of intimate relationships they may establish with someone they like. Some parents may be afraid that falling into an early-stage romantic relation could be a distraction for their innocent kids, for which they may skip their regular classes to date or even earn a bad grades in their mid-term or final exams. Due to these fears and worries, parents usually curb any of their children’s close connection with a boy or a girl in the cradle. Nevertheless, this is unhealthy to a child’s mental development because owning a longtime and steady relationship is an indispensable component in people’s life. If children have never had any experience of dealing with the person they have a crush on, they are likely to be sensitive to the other’s emotional reaction, thus being emotionally vulnerable when they become an adult. In another word, isolating children from any access to any romantic relationship is too severe for them to follow. Admittedly, rules sometimes are necessary because they could do good to children’s self-discipline and future development. For instance, too much entertainment and leisure could cause a child to indulge himself in it and get addicted; falling in love with another person and thus forming an unhealthy obsession could cost a young child too much and take him a long time to recover. All these incidents just show the necessity of rules and disciplines. But leaving children no time for fun and relaxation is too absolute, arbitrary and even devastating and we should make every effort to stop extremes from happening. In a nutshell, we should avoid those too strict rules and guide our children in a healthy and sustainable way.

    1.our society has witnessed and experienced ...
    2.which is why...
    3.set a limit on
    4.make their children more competent than their peers.

### Media - TPO 52 :video_camera:
    Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television have more negative effects than positive effects on the way young people behave. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

>​	Due to the occurrence of modern social media, we are entering a new era of information exploration. We absorb a variety of information on a daily basis, from the latest political campaign to the cutting-edge medical discovery and we are witnessing the world developing at a rapid rate. Nevertheless, this leads people to the discussion of the impact of daily social media.
>
>​	 One side assumes that movies and television brings about more positive and proactive influence on the way people behave. ***However, I am a firm believer in that harmful effects outweigh beneficial ones.***The reasons and examples are as follows. In the first place, the crime rate all over the world is now escalating, which may result from the violent fighting scenes and storyline of some films as well as TV programs. In order to boost audience rating, many producers are likely to add a number of violent and scary elements into their programs. Siblings may turn back on each other just for the purpose of family legacy; Spouses would think of murders because they are afraid that their affair may be found by their beloved ones; a protagonist, in order to save hostages, may kill so many good-bad men with destructive weapons. All these plots and stories would definitely mislead the youth to imitate the characters' words and behaviors. No wonder juvenile delinquency is showing up unexpectedly. This is one piece of solid evidence about the negative effects of movies and television. In the second place, the morality is torn apart due to many dark information existing in the social media. In the past, people could hardly imagine that their close friends or best mate would deceive them. Especially, in those ancient civilization, loyalty is the quality valued quite much by the whole community and people who made use of traps to set up their friends would be despised by others. However, the circumstance has changed drastically. For the sake of one’s own interest, they could take any action whatever the cost, even including hurting the ones who love them most. With more and more appearance of such incidents, a not-to-trust-anyone atmosphere is prevailing and dominating. This may also be brought about by many TV serials that we watch each day, such as Desperate Housewives, Gossip Girls and so forth. Admittedly, social media do have their bright sides. For instance, Sesame Street, one educational TV program in the U.S., which was once very popular among children. The young people can learn various scientific knowledge and discoveries in it. What’s more, the characters are very entertaining and humorous, which make children love it even more. However, from my own perspective, given the current situation, the dark sides of social media definitely outrun the bright ones and it is urgent for us to think of solutions to compensate. In a nutshell, I suppose movies and television have more detrimental influence than positive one on how young people behave.

### Family - TPO 28 :house:
    Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents today are more involved in their children’s education than were parents in the past.Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

>The involvement of parents in their children’s education has been acknowledged to include not only the exact knowledge and values they would tell their children but also the attention they would pay to their children’s educational process as well as the role they would play during the decision-making process. From my perspective, modern parents are more related to their children’s educational aspects than parents are in the past. It could not be denied that parents in the modern society would bear much more responsibilities and burdens as well than those in the past such as the financial pressure to support the family, due to the increasing desire of individuals and the economic reality in the present society. That means modern parents would spend plenty of time on earning money and have less time to be with their children or to actually teach them. However, the real situation regarding the children education is that parents in the present are more likely to emphasize the education of their children in various respects such as arranging the detailed study plan for their children. Moreover, the emphasis children would receive on their education from the parents has been increased significantly in the contemporary society, because of the fact that individuals now have generally believed in the essential influence of the education on people especially the younger generation. That significance could be realized by the modern parents during their working and social experiences, and it to a great extent could be comprehended due to the reality that the well-educated person has been demanded in relatively every area of the current society. Therefore, in order to help their children to become successful and qualified, parents in the present have been inclined to check or help with their school projects, to have them acquire multiple skills, and to expect them to receive the best education at a higher level, which would not ***be the focus of*** the parents in the past who even did not care about the educational situation of their children and merely held the expectation that the children could help to support the family in terms of the finance as soon as possible. Furthermore, it has been proposed that current parents have been more active during the process of making decisions related to their children's educational choices than the past. That could suggest that to some extent they would like to exert an influence on the children and their educational affairs rather than be willing to let their children to have the independent decision-making process as they did in the past, which might be due to the possibility that the present parents might place more emphasis on their children’s education and not want them to make any mistakes. However, this situation could probably be interpreted that the modern parents could be considered to be the better educated people themselves and could assist their children to choose wisely and appropriately by offering the relevant information and reasonable advice in the course of educational matters such as how to plan their time arrangements, what major they would study in, and whether they should have a gap year before entering the university. In conclusion, although modern parents might have less time with their children than those in the past during their educational period, they definitely could be regarded as more active in the participation in their children's educational activities in terms of the attention they might pay and the positive effort they might provide to help their children to make educational decisions due to the fact that they perceive the importance.

### Lifestyle - TPO49 :swimming_man:
    Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?The ability to maintain friendships with a small number of people over a long period of time is more important for happiness than the ability to make many new friends easily.Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

> Friendship and kinship contribute a lot to one’s happiness. Then, the question goes, “does the ability to main long-term friendships with a small number of people matters more than the ability to make many new friends easily?” My answer is “yes”.  First of all, old friends usually show stronger loyalty than those newly-acquainted fellows. That means, no matter what happens, these friends would always stand by your side and provide you with supports unconditionally. However, this merit is usually missing in short-term friendship. Last year when I was in hospital, 2 of my old friends took turns to take care of me, accompanying me to endure the very hard time. However, few of my “wide-range” new friends even came to visit me. It is clearly that long-term friendship is much more reliable and the ability to main such kind of relationship is more critical.  In addition, old friends tend to show more understanding of you, being familiar with your hobbies, interests and some other peculiarities. So, it is usually more comfortable for me to be with my old friends. For instance, I am lactose intolerant and every time when I have dinner with my old friends, they would skip anything that contains milk or cheese, ordering food based on my favor. Contrary to my old friends’ consideration, those newly-acquainted fellows are inclined to show surprise about my intolerance and still pick the food of lactose they prefer. So, to me, old friends are much more considerate and contribute more to my happiness.  Admittedly, the ability to make new friends easily are quite important for a person to get new ideas, broadening their views from different groups of people. However, compared with the ability to maintain long-term friendship, it still plays a less significant role for one’s happiness.  To sum up, one’s happiness is consist of various parts, including self-achievement, security and etc. And I believe long-term friendship is of higher importance than other parts. As a result, the ability to maintain long-term friendship with a small group of people is much more important.

### Technology - TPO11 :battery:
    Some people say that the Internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

>Internet must be one of the greatest inventions during the 20th century. It shortens the distance between people all over the world by providing various kinds and large amounts of information. In my point of view, I agree that Internet can provide a lot of valuable information, which would benefit us in the long run without troubling at all. By surfing through the Internet, we can get large quantities of useful skills, which can benefit ourselves, from the information that is available on the Internet. Learning these skills can help us keep healthy, gain more money or even improve our living standard. In my country, there used to be some isolated villages, where books and knowledge are hard to spread. People living in these villages lack the basic skills to have a good harvest and they live in the really poor condition. Meanwhile, our government has helped them to have access to the Internet recently and the villagers can get the information they want without any difficulties. By using this information, they improved their living conditions. Therefore, information getting from the Internet can benefit our lives. Another important aspect is the current affairs. Internet could offer us a lot of information about things happened all over the world without peopling travelling around the world. From the new scientific discovery to the war in the Middle East, from the economic crisis happened in Europe to the World  Cup  held  in  South  Africa,  things  happened  in  every  corner  of  the  world  can  be  known worldwide in no minute through the Internet. Under this circumstance, people can have their own opinions on these affairs, or they can give their hands to the ones who need help. Internet gives us a chance to learn more about the whole world by proving us information. Admittedly, there is some unreal information on the Internet. On the contrary, I do not think it as a trouble at all. The existence of unreal information forces us to be critical thinking and have the ability to tell the truth. In addition, it is the person who creates unreal news rather than the Internet to be blamed. All in all, the Internet is a great tool to offer us tremendous amount of information. Surrounded by large amount of information can broad our sight and make us more intelligent rather than trap us into troubles.

It can be classified into two notions: leading skills and charisma. Leading skills can be learned but charisma comes naturally. First of all, leading skills refer to several specific techniques which can be mastered after systematic training. These techniques include the decomposition of big goals, the use of incentive mechanism, proper distribution of work, tips on balancing the interests of various parties and so on. Experts in management field have already work out mature theories or principles in these aspects. With adequate practice, it is not difficult to use them skillfully. Furthermore, even if without systematic theories, leading skills can be improved through the accumulation of practical experience. A man whose major has nothing to do with management can still become an outstanding team leader if he has the experience to be an organizer in his college clubs. How to make the whole team collaborate efficiently and fulfill the goal in a firm sometimes is common with the same thing in a university. In contrast, a person with no relevant experience will find it harder to lead a team at first. But he will make it at last after enough practice. Nevertheless, differently from specific leading skills, charisma in most cases can’t be acquired through special training. This kind of glamour refers to the attraction which can cast positive impact on his subordinates. Such kind of attractive power comes from the leader’s nature disposition which is to some extent hard to change during one’s life and rich social experience which is impossible to get by merely absorbing indirect experience. In general, charisma comes naturally and only a few of us has this kind of spiritual attraction who make great contributions in human’s history. But for ordinary people like us, some useful leading techniques is enough for us. We have easy access to these specific methods thanks to the Internet era. Knowledge spreads widely on the Internet. What’s better, a large sum of them charge nothing. Therefore, it is not difficult for us to become a qualified team leader.

### Government - TPO 54 :memo:
    Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for governments to spend money to improve Internet access than to improve public transportation. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

>​	The development of science and technology has come to pervade every aspect of our lives, especially the influence from the internet, which is changing people's life in a quite unprecedented speed, and as a result, some people consider government should spend money to improve internet access. After taking various factors into consideration, I, on the contrary, reckon that improving public transportation deserves more financial support from the government. Firstly, improvement of public transportation could help to solve the serious environmental problems nowadays. Undoubtedly, the disastrous consequence of environmental pollution has been quite obvious, such as the gloomy haze obscuring the top of the skyscrapers, acid rain poisoning farmland and eroding buildings, sea level rise resulting from global temperature rise etc., which urgently calls for effective measures to resolve all these life-threatening challenges. Public transportation capable of vast passenger volume could be one efficient way to take the place of various private vehicles whose exhaust emission is the main pollutants. For example, I am living in one city in North China that suffered bitterly from air pollution. In order to recover the blue sky, last year our government carried out one policy to lower the price of the bus together with improved services. Not surprisingly, more passengers chose to take public transportation. With less exhaust emission from the private vehicles, the air quality was improved since then. Secondly, compared with internet access, public transportation could benefit more people. Admittedly, with the appearance of various social softwares, internet, because of its efficiency and convenience, does serve as one important role in communication, but not everyone can be proficient or even familiar with internet. We should not ignore the sobering fact that there are still a large amount of illiterate people especially in the remote poverty-stricken areas. Being unable to read or type prevents them from getting online no matter how convenient the Internet access is. By contrast, public transportation could help those areas to connect with outside developed urban areas to develop their economy. The railway connecting eastern China and Tibet could be one persuasive example. Before this railway was built, the lagging economic situation in Tibet constrained the improving of people's living standard. Many family even could not afford their children to get education, while after the Chinese government built the railway to connect Tibet to the outside developed areas, Tibet's economy has been developing dramatically as the railway introduces more industries and encourages tourism, and as a result, large numbers of local people could benefit from what the public transportation promises. Conclusively, since public transportation could ensure both improved environment and economy, the government is highly advised to spend money on improving public transportation.
